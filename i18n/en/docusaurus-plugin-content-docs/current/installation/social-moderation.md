# Social Media Moderation

## Introduction

Logora provides an **admin dashboard for automatic social media moderation**, allowing users to connect their **Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook pages** and automate the moderation of comments using advanced algorithms such as **Mistral Moderation Services**.  

The goal is to **identify and automatically reject content** that violates legal regulations, contains scams, or is unreadable. Users have full transparency over all actions taken, with the ability to override moderation decisions if needed.  

## **1. Creating an Admin Space**  

To start using Logora‚Äôs social media moderation tool, follow these steps:  

1. **Sign up for an admin space** at [this link](https://admin.logora.fr/#/signup?appType=socialModeration).  
2. Once registered, access your **dashboard**, where you can connect your **Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook** accounts to Logora.  

After connecting your accounts, Logora will begin retrieving comments and applying moderation rules automatically.

## **2. Connecting Social Media Pages**  

### üîπ **2.1 Requirements for Connection**  
- You **must be an administrator** with full rights on the page or channel you want to connect.  
- Logora requires **read and retrieve permissions** for comments to moderate them effectively.  

### üîπ **2.2 Connecting YouTube Channels**  
- If you manage **multiple YouTube channels**, they must be connected **one by one**.  

### üîπ **2.3 Connecting Facebook Pages**  
- For Facebook, you can either:  
  - **Connect all pages at once**, or  
  - **Select individual pages** and modify the selection later.

Below are two images illustrating the Facebook connection process:

## **3. How Automatic Moderation Works**  

###  üîç  **3.1 AI-Powered Moderation**  
Logora‚Äôs moderation tool is powered by **Mistral Moderation Services**, which automatically handles **95% of comments** based on predefined rules.  

- At the start, **human moderators manually review all comments** to ensure the AI is making accurate decisions.  
- If the AI **misclassifies** a comment, moderators **correct the mistake**, and this corrected data is sent back to the AI to **train a fine-tuned model** for better accuracy.  

### üí° **3.2 Full Transparency and Manual Overrides**  
- All **retrieved, accepted, and rejected** comments are **visible in the admin dashboard**.  
- Users can **override moderation decisions** at any time.
  
### **3.3 Difference Between Website & Social Media Moderation**  
- Logora‚Äôs moderation for **partner websites** is **stricter** and **more human-driven** since site owners are legally responsible for user-generated content.  
- On **social media**, moderation is more **automated**, as responsibility primarily lies with the platform hosting the content.

## üìä **4.Monitoring Engagement and Performance**  

The **admin dashboard** provides detailed insights into:  
- **The number of comments and votes retrieved** for each social media platform.

We are continuously improving üöÄ the dashboard to allow users to:
