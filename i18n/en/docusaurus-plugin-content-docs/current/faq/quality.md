The quality of the content published on your site is a legal and editorial issue. 

We guarantee calm, interesting and readable discussions.

The arguments published are of good quality and those put forward are the best worked. 

It works as follows: 

1) The posted arguments are sent to the moderation manager (the Logora team, in the vast majority of cases).  
They are moderated a priori. 80% to 85% of arguments are processed automatically, i.e. instantly. 
15% to 20% of arguments are processed manually, every 24 hours. 

2) The arguments validated by the moderation are published. Our relevance algorithm rates each contribution and highlights those that appear to be the most well thought out. 

#### How moderation works

Moderation management is offered by Logora (recommended solution), it can also be handled by your moderation providers. 

The moderation process is as follows: we have built a moderation algorithm by labelling over 45,000 contributions. 

The algorithm automatically accepts arguments that are considered readable, well-written and non-hateful. When the algorithm is not sure of the quality of the argument (unknown source, new turns of phrase, new concepts), the argument is sent to a member of our team for manual moderation. 

This concerns 15 to 20% of the arguments. We perform moderation every 24 hours on weekdays. Pending posts are seen as published by their authors to make their experience more fluid. 

All of our moderators are native speakers and have a university degree. 

We have processed over two million arguments for all of our partners with a 100% success rate of detecting hateful, unreadable and illegal messages.

Our moderation interface is visible from your administration area. Our work is transparent and you have the possibility to intervene (accept/reject contributions) if you wish. 

On this example, you can see a list of arguments passed by the moderation algorithm: some are automatically accepted, others rejected and pending.

A low moderation score means that the algorithm considers the argument to be safe: several such arguments have been accepted in the past, it may accept it automatically. 
A high moderation score means that this kind of argument is unknown or has been rejected in the past. In this case, the argument is put on hold for human review.

To learn more about setting up moderation, read our documentation article in *Configuration > Moderation*. 

#### How the argument prioritisation works

We have created a "relevance" algorithm that highlights the best written arguments. 

The objective is to make your contribution space as interesting as possible on the one hand, and to reward the most invested participants on the other hand. 

The relevance algorithm is independent of the moderation algorithm. 

The question we ask is: once the arguments are good (after moderation), how do we choose which ones deserve to be put forward?

It is not our role to judge the substance of arguments, so we look at their form and structure to distinguish them. 

For example, respect for spelling, punctuation and the addition of reliable sources have a positive impact on the score given to the argument. 

This operation is fully automated, however the grade of an argument can be modified a posteriori from your administration space.

Between two well written, developed and sourced arguments, it is difficult to judge that one argument is more interesting than another.
However, this feature allows the best written arguments to be rewarded by distinguishing them from shorter and less constructed arguments.
