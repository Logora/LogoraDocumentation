#### Sending emails for your account

## I. Content

**NL:**
We send out a weekly newsletter for your account to debaters registered on your debate space and active in the last 90 days. 
It presents the ten most popular debates of the week to your registered debaters. 

**Response email:**
We send an email to a debater when someone replies directly to them on a debate. 

**Follow-up debate:**
Finally, we send an email to a debater when someone adds an argument on a debate they are following. 

A maximum of one email per day is sent to users.
All other actions (receiving a vote, being followed by someone...) are subject to notifications on your debate space, on-site.

## II. Impact

If you are using Google Analytics, you can track the results of your email campaigns using utm media tags. 

> On average, these emails have an open rate of 26.2% and a click rate of 6.3%. 

Here are the parameters added for each of the mails: 

**Results of "newsletter" mails

utm_source=logora, utm_medium=email, utm_campaign=trending_debates_weekly

**Results of "reply to an argument" mails

utm_source=logora, utm_medium=email, utm_campaign=argument_reply

**Results of the "debate followed up" mails

utm_source=logora, utm_medium=email, utm_campaign=debate_follow

If you wish to monitor other indicators, please send us your request by email. 

## III. Consent management

Debaters can unsubscribe from emails received from their debater profile or directly from the email received. 

We indicate to send the email on your behalf at the bottom of the email, positioning Logora as a data processor within the legal framework in force.
