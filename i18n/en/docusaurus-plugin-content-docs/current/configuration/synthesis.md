#### 

Depending on the modules you activate and your specific needs, the code placed on the article can be displayed in different ways. 

Note that the code is displayed at the point where you insert it. 

Most of our partners display the contributor space at the end of the article, but others display it at the heart of the article (mainly before the last paragraph) due to constraints linked to their advertising contracts.

On this ["sandbox" demo url](https://demo.logora.fr/synthese.html), you can see how the different types of display look (debates, comments, consultations, compressed or uncompressed formats)... 

Everything can be adapted to your size and positioning constraints. 

## I. Debate question

**Automatic insertion on the article:**

The debate question, called "summary", is displayed wherever the code is inserted on your article page (heart of article, foot of article, or elsewhere).

1) [The recommended debate question block](https://demo.logora.fr/synthese.html) (better engagement rate).

2) If you have size constraints, we suggest [a more discreet call to action](https://demo.logora.fr/widget.html) (lower engagement rate).

If the code is not automatically inserted on your article page, or if you want to insert a debate outside an article, our iframe code allows you to insert the recommended debate question block. 

This iframe code is available in your administration area once the debate has been created. It can take either of the two forms shown above, depending on your display preferences. 

**Home page module:**

The "home page" module displays the debate question you wish to pin. It only offers a vote and does not display a user argument. 

[An example here](https://demo.logora.fr/group_embed.html) (in an article but which can also be displayed outside an article). 

## II. Comments

A comments module, complementary to the existing contributor space, allows you to activate comments when an article is not concerned by a debate.

[The module displays the best comments (https://demo.logora.fr/comments.html) and can be used as a bridge to the debate area, as here. 

The module can also present a simple call to action "Comment" without displaying the best comments if you don't have enough space. 

## III.consultations

The [Consultation module](https://demo.logora.fr/consultation_embed.html) is displayed with the best contribution and a call to action "Give your opinion". 

## IV. Inserting arguments and comments into articles

Like a tweet embed, you can insert arguments and comments into your articles. 

An [example of an argument inserted here](https://demo.logora.fr/argument_embed.html)
