Logora blends in with your visual identity from the administration area via the "Customisation" tab.

### Customise colours, texts and fonts

The colours, the font and the texts and the urls of your space` are customisable from the tab "Configuration" > "Customisation".

All colours are available. There are about ten fonts available, if yours is missing please let us know so that we can add it to your space. 

Most of the texts in the debate space ("Follow the debate", "All the debates" etc ) can be modified from the "Texts" tab. If one of the texts you wish to modify is missing, please let us know so that we can add it to your space. 

### Customise other elements of the debate space

If you have additional customisation elements that you would like to see (icons, evolution of the gamification navigation system or other), please send us your ideas. We'll take a close look at them. Ideally, you send us mock-ups of what you want.
