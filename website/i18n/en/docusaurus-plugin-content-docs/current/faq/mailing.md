#### Sending emails for your account

## I.Content

We send a weekly newsletter on your behalf to all the registered debaters on your debate space. 

It offers the ten most popular debates of the week to your registered debaters.  

We also send an email to a debater when someone responds directly to them on a debate. 

Finally, we send an email to a debater when someone adds an argument to a debate they are following. 

A maximum of one email per day is sent to users. 

:::note

Only the newsletter, the direct response to an argument and the addition of an argument to a debate being followed are subject to mailings. 

:::

All other actions (receiving a vote, being followed by someone...) are subject to notifications on your debate space, on-site.
