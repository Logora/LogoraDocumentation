### 1) How user creation works

When a user participates in your discussion space for the first time, they create a profile. 

This profile is created automatically when the user is registered in your system, as described in the articles on [Single Sign On](../authentication/introduction.md).

You send us the following information: first name / last name / e-mail so that we can create the user's profile. 

### 2) Alias and onboarding

If you don't send us a first name / last name, we'll generate aliases for your users. 

If you wish, we can add an onboarding pop-up to ask the user to change their first / last name and avatar. 

<img src="/img/onboardingbox.png" alt="User onboarding" width="400"/>

In this case, you need to ask Logora to activate this parameter. 

Alternatively, the default avatar library can be replaced by your own images. In this case, contact Logora.
