![Configuration de la modération](/img/moderation.png)

#### Type of moderation

`Before publication of the content` : contributions will go through moderation before their publication (moderation *a priori*)  
`After publication of the content`: contributions will be published and then go through moderation (moderation *a posteriori*)

#### Moderation method

`Manual`: you manage the moderation via the administration area  
`Intelligent`: Logora takes care of the moderation. Logora's moderation algorithms have already processed more than 100,000 contributions, with a detection rate of 97% of hateful messages. When a contribution is not certified as 100% compliant by our tools, our moderation team takes over to check the content.

`Third party`: Logora integrates with external moderation services:
- Netino
- Bodyguard
    
If you wish to use one of these two integrations or another one not listed here, contact our team via `contact@logora.fr`.
