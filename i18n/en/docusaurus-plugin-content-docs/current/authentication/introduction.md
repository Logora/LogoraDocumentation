If you don't have a registration and login method on your site or you want to use Logora's login module, go to your [Administration Space](https://admin.logora.fr)  (*Configuration > Authentication*) and choose the `Social` authentication mode. You can then go directly to the [customization of your debate space](configuration/theme.md).

If you want your users to use your own authentication module to participate in the debate space, use Single Sign-On (SSO).

#### Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On allows users to log in to your site and use the Logora plugin without logging in a second time to Logora.


Single sign-on will create a site-specific user profile on Logora so as not to conflict with existing Logora users.


Logora offers several possible authentication modes:
- OAuth 2.0 server authentication (you have an OAuth 2.0 server)
- Authentication by JWT signature
