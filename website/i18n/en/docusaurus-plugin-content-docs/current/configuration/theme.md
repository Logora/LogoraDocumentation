### Customize the colors, texts and font

`The colors and the font` can be customized from the administration space via the "Customization" tab.

`All the texts` on the debate space ("Follow the debate", "All the debates" ect ) are also editable from the "Texts" tab.

> For example, the main color, that is to say the color of the main buttons like "Write a message" or "Follow a debate" is modifiable via the hexadecimal code located under the title "Main color".

> In the same manner, it is possible to modify the color of the camp one 'as well as the colors of the thesis two (label of the messages, color of the titles delimiting the sections...).
