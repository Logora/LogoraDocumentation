### Roles 

Three roles are available on the Logora administration space. 

They are more or less permissive, here are their details from the most important role to the most restricted role. 

#### Administrator

Allows the member to control everything: moderation, manage debates, access the space's configurations and send other invitations.

#### Journalist

His/her main role is to create debates. They also have access to the arguments and can moderate if they wish. 

#### Moderator

Can only do moderation, often a role dedicated to the Logora teams or to your service providers in charge of moderation.
