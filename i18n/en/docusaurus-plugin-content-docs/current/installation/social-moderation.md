# Social Media Moderation

## Introduction

Logora provides an **admin dashboard for automatic social media moderation**, allowing users to connect their **Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook pages** and automate the moderation of comments using advanced algorithms such as **Mistral Moderation Services**.  

The goal is to **identify and automatically reject content** that violates legal regulations, contains scams, or is unreadable. Users have full transparency over all actions taken, with the ability to override moderation decisions if needed.

## **1. Creating an Admin Space**  

To start using Logora’s social media moderation tool, follow these steps:  

1. **Sign up for an admin space** at [this link](https://admin.logora.fr/#/signup?appType=socialModeration).  
2. Once registered, access your **dashboard**, where you can connect your **Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook** accounts to Logora.  

After connecting your accounts, Logora will begin retrieving comments and applying moderation rules automatically.

## **2. Connecting Social Media Pages**  

To enable automatic moderation, you must **link your pages to Logora’s system**.  

### **2.1 Requirements for Connection**  
- You **must be an administrator** with full rights on the page or channel you want to connect.  
- Logora requires **read and retrieve permissions** for comments to moderate them effectively.  

### **2.2 Connecting YouTube Channels**  
- If you manage **multiple YouTube channels**, they must be connected **one by one**.  

### **2.3 Connecting Facebook Pages**  
- For Facebook, you can either:  
  - **Connect all pages at once**, or  
  - **Select individual pages** and modify the selection later.  

Below are two images illustrating the Facebook connection process:  

1. **Initial selection of pages to connect**

## **3. How Automatic Moderation Works**  

### **3.1 AI-Powered Moderation**  
Logora’s moderation tool is powered by **Mistral Moderation Services**, which automatically handles **95% of comments** based on predefined rules.  

- At the start, **human moderators manually review all comments** to ensure the AI is making accurate decisions.  
- If the AI **misclassifies** a comment, moderators **correct the mistake**, and this corrected data is sent back to the AI to **train a fine-tuned model** for better accuracy.  

### **3.2 Full Transparency and Manual Overrides**  
- All **retrieved, accepted, and rejected** comments are **visible in the admin dashboard**.  
- Users can **override moderation decisions** at any time.  

### **3.3 Difference Between Website & Social Media Moderation**  
- Logora’s moderation for **partner websites** is **stricter** and **more human-driven** since site owners are legally responsible for user-generated content.  
- On **social media**, moderation is more **automated**, as responsibility primarily lies with the platform hosting the content.

## **4. Monitoring Engagement and Performance**  

The **admin dashboard** provides detailed insights into:  
- **The number of comments and votes retrieved** for each social media platform.  
- **The most popular posts**, based on engagement metrics.  

We are continuously improving the dashboard to allow users to:  
- **Analyze engagement trends** over time.  
- **Compare performance across different social media platforms**.  
- **Identify topics that drive the most reactions** and understand audience behavior.

## **Conclusion**  

By integrating Logora’s **automatic moderation system**, businesses and publishers can **maintain a clean and legally compliant online presence** while reducing manual moderation efforts.
