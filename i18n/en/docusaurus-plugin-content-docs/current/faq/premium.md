title: Preview of new features  
---

Logora's technical team imagines, designs and develops new projects every month to improve your space. 

For example, in the summer of 2022 we developed a comment space linked to the debate space, an advanced statistics panel for your administration space and a module that automatically links a debate to articles based on the proposed topic. 

These developments are being tested internally for several weeks and then rolled out to our closest partners before being extended to everyone. 

If you would like to be notified first about modules that have been successfully tested internally and to be the first to be deployed, please send us an email to contact@logora.fr. 

Please indicate in the email if you wish to: 

1. Allow Logora to deploy all the new modules in priority on your site.
2. Allow Logora to deploy only the new features concerning the visual improvement of the interface. 
3. Simply be notified of new features as soon as they are available.
