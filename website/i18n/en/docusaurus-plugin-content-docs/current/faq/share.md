title: Share user arguments

You can share the arguments and proposals of your users directly in your articles, in iframe format.

Like a tweet embed, you can highlight the contributions of your community wherever you want. 

This allows you to feed your articles, but especially to highlight your privileged relationship with your readers. 

To do so, you need to click on the share argument button, then on the "Embed content" icon located on the right side of the bubble.
