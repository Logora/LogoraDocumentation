title: Participating as a journalist
---

You can invite journalists to participate in the debate space by assigning them the "Journalist" title. This allows them to interact with other users transparently.

By having the "Journalist" title, they can respond on behalf of their publication, provide additional information if necessary, and answer questions from users.

The display on an argument or response would look like this:

### How it works

Any person with access to the administration space can add the "journalist" certification to registered users from the administration area.

To do this, they need to search for the user in the "Users" section, click on their profile, and check the "journalist" box.
